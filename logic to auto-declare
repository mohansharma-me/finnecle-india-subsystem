	get current time
	get current date
	find draw related to current time
	find that draw is already proceed or not
	if not then continue otherwise quit
	get total donation of that draw
	get automatic ratio of that draw
	get pivot totaldonation*automaticratio/100
find all donations for each ngo
now select ngo which has donation amount lower than pivot amount
now filter that ngos in desc order based on amount as well as userCount
and select first ngo from that filtered list
